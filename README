How much memory can my MySQL server eat?

Licensed under GPLv2+

It's based on maximum memory usage of mysql server:

Mysql_max_memory_usage =
       Query_cache_size      +   Key_buffer_size         +
       Myisam_sort_buffer_size   +   Innodb_buffer_pool_size     +
       Innodb_log_buffer_size    +   Innodb_additional_mem_pool_size +
       Max_connections       *
       (
           Sort_buffer_size        +   Read_buffer_size        +
           Read_rnd_buffer_size    +   Join_buffer_size        +
           Thread_stack
       )
